<h1>Important Concepts</h1>

<h2>Lesson 1: The Basics of the Web and HTML</h2>

<div>
  <p>
    <b>How the Web Works</b>
  </p>
  <p>
    The web is a bunch of computers that communicate with each other. When a person goes to a web
    page like www.google.com, their computer sends a <em>HTTP Request</em> to a <em>server</em>. The
    server finds the appropriate HTML document and sends it back to the user's computer where a
    <em>web browser</em> interprets the page and displays it on the user's screen.

    does a good job of explaining.

    <b>HTML</b>
  </p>
  <p>
    HTML stands for <em>Hypertext Markup Language.</em> HTML documents form the majority of the
    content on the web. HTML documents contain <em>text content</em> which describes "what you see"
    and <em>markup</em> which describes "how it looks".
    <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud721/l-3508959201/m-48724340"> This
    video</a> gives a good overview.

  <p>
    <b>Tags and Elements</b>
  </p>
  <p>
    HTML documents are made of HTML <b>elements</b>. When writing HTML, we tell browsers the type of
    each element by using HTML <b>tags</b>.
    <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud721/l-3508959201/m-48723444">This video</a>
    explains the distinction well.

    <b>Why Computers are Stupid</b>
  </p>
  <p>
    Computers are stupid because they interpret instructions literally. This makes them very unforgiving
    since a small mistake by a programmer can cause huge problems in a program.
  </p>

<div>
  <p>
    <b>Inline vs Block Elements</b>
  </p>
  <p>
    HTML elements are either <b>inline</b> or <b>block</b>. Block elements form an "invisible box" around the
    content inside of them.
