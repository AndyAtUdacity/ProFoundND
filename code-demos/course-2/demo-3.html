          Most machines (like a toaster) are designed to do a few things. Unless you physically
          alter these machines, they will only be able to do those things.

          Computers are different. A computer can be <b>programmed</b> to do anything we want, as long as
          we can write a program that specifies a <em>specific sequence of instructions</em>.

          A program is a precise sequence of steps that a computer can follow to do something useful. Web browsers,
          games, mobile apps, and simple print statements are all examples of computer programs.

        Programming Language

      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
          A programming language is what programmers use to tell a computer what to do. Python is one example of a programming language.

      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
          Python is a programming language. When you write Python code and press "Run", a <em>Python Interpreter</em> converts
          the code you wrote as a set of instructions that the computer itself can understand and execute.

        Grammar
      </div>
      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
          Just like human languages have grammars, programming languages do too.  A grammar is a specification of what is "correct"
          and what is "incorrect."
        </p>
        <p>
          In languages like English, people can ofent make sense of sentences that aren't technically "correct," but computers aren't smart enough to do this.
          This means we have to write code that is exactly "correct" according to the Python interpreter, otherwise
          our code won't run.

        Python Expressions
      </div>
      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
          A Python "expression" is a legal Python statement. For example: <span class="code">print 1 + 1</span> is a valid expression, but <span class="code">print 1 +</span> (without a number at the end) is not.
